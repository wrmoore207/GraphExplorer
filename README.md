# GraphExplorer


**Project Description**
Create a Graph Explorer program that allows users to interact with and explore graphs represented using both an adjacency matrix and an adjacency list. The program should enable users to visualize the graph, perform depth-first and breadth-first traversals, and gain insights into the structure and connectivity of the graph.

**Key Features:**

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Allow users to input and visualize a graph through an interactive interface.
   - Implement options to represent the graph using both an adjacency matrix and an adjacency list.

2. **Traversal Algorithms:**
   - Implement depth-first traversal for both the adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations.
   - Implement breadth-first traversal for both representations.
   - Display the traversal path step by step, highlighting the nodes as they are visited.

3. **Graph Visualization:**
   - Utilize a graphical user interface to display the graph visually.
   - Include features such as node and edge highlighting during traversals.
   - Provide a clear representation of the adjacency matrix and adjacency list.

4. **User Interaction:**
   - Allow users to add and remove nodes and edges dynamically.
   - Enable users to switch between adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations seamlessly.
   - Provide information about the degree, neighbors, and other properties of selected nodes.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Implement classes for the graph, adjacency matrix, and adjacency list.
   - Develop methods to add and remove nodes and edges in both representations.

2. **Traversal Algorithms:**
   - Implement depth-first and breadth-first traversal algorithms for both representations.
   - Display the traversal path in real-time with appropriate visual cues.

3. **Graph Visualization:**
   - Utilize a GUI library (e.g., Tkinter for Python) to create an interactive graphical interface.
   - Design an intuitive representation of the graph, allowing users to interact with nodes and edges.

4. **User Interaction:**
   - Implement buttons and controls for users to perform traversals, switch representations, and modify the graph.
   - Include tooltips or information panes for additional details about nodes and edges.

**Extensions (Optional):**

1. **Graph Metrics:**
   - Calculate and display metrics like the diameter, connected components, and centrality of the graph.

2. **Path Finding:**
   - Implement algorithms to find and visualize the shortest path between two selected nodes.

**Outcome:**
The Graph Explorer program will serve as a visual and interactive tool for understanding graph representations and traversals, providing users with a hands-on experience to explore the fascinating world of graphs. This project will showcase your proficiency in implementing graph-related data structures and algorithms.
